● Performed multiple types of regression and hyperparameter tuning. Built pipeline for the final model.
● Random forest regressor provides the best results with 90% R-squared and 3.7 MAE, hence this
model can be used further for predictions
● This model can be used to automate material quality inspection during the manufacturing process in
order to reduce human intervention while achieving human-level or better accuracy

Problem Statement

● Coffee roasting is the process of turning green coffee beans into brown ones. Brown coffee beans
can be made in a variety of methods, which also influences the flavor of the end product. A roasting
instrument is basically a convection oven. It is a mechanism of inflicting heat energy into the raw
product which makes the product consumable. And the price of coffee is heavily influenced by the
quality of the beans after roasting. As a result, the cost can be determined depending on the quality
of the beans after roasting.
● The rising automation in the manufacturing business necessitates the automation of quality
inspection of output products with minimal human intervention. Quality inspectors in businesses
examine product quality after it is manufactured to ensure that it meets industry standards.
● Each product's quality inspection is a time-consuming manual process, and a low-quality product
wastes upstream factory capacity, consumables, labor, and money. With the emerging AI trend,
companies are looking to leverage machine learning-based technologies to automate material
quality inspection during the manufacturing process to reduce human intervention while achieving
human-level or better accuracy.
